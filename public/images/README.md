## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency (recommended) or JPG
- **Size**: 
  - Heroes: 400x400px to 600x600px (will be scaled)
  - Villains: 300x300px to 400x400px (circular avatars)

## Image Sources

You can find Spider-Man character images from:
- Marvel official websites
- Free image resources (ensure you have rights to use)
- Create your own themed graphics
- Use placeholder images initially

The portfolio will work without these images, but they enhance the visual theme!

## Adding Images

1. Download or create the images
2. Place them in the appropriate subdirectories
3. Use exact filenames as listed above
4. Refresh the browser to see changes

Images are optional - the site will gracefully handle missing images.
